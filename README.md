# clima_up

App made with Flutter to fetch and load weather data of your current or requested location.

## Getting Started

There is one you need to keep in mind __before running the app__...

In lib/utilities/constants.dart:

- The constant named __apiKey__ requires and actual API key to run the app
- Goto __https://openweathermap.org/api__ and scroll down to section called __Current & Forecast weather data collection__, you'll find various API services that help to fetch different kinds of data
- The one we have leveraged in this project is __Current Weather Data__
- Generate your API key from this website and paste it as a string-value to constant apiKey

### You're ready to go...!
